Write the following three programs and submit all source code to this remote repo.

# 1) reverseString.cpp

## Overview

This project is a fun introduction to using strings in C++. You will create a simple program that takes a user's input string and reverses it. For example, if the user inputs "hello", the program will output "olleh".

## Objectives
Learn to manipulate C++ strings.
Understand loops in C++.
Practice getting user input and displaying output.

## Requirements
The program should ask the user to type a word or a sentence.
It should reverse the string entered by the user.
The reversed string should be displayed as output.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
Create a program that prompts the user to enter a string.
Store the user input in a string variable.
Use a loop to reverse the string.
Display the reversed string to the user.

## Tips
Remember that strings in C++ are indexed starting from 0.
A loop can be used to access each character of the string from the end to the beginning.
Test your program with different inputs to make sure it works as expected.

## Extension Ideas
Modify the program to ignore spaces while reversing (e.g., "hello world" becomes "dlrowolleh").
Enhance the program to reverse each word in the sentence individually but keep the word order (e.g., "hello world" becomes "olleh dlrow").

## Submission Guidelines
Submit your source code with comments explaining your logic.
Ensure your code is neatly formatted and easy to read.
Test your program with various inputs to ensure reliability.

# 2) funWithFunctions.cpp

## Overview
In this project, you will explore the use of functions in C++. You will create a program that involves three distinct functions: getAnIntFromTheUser, compareTwoInts, and sumTwoInts. The program will demonstrate how functions can be used to break down a problem into smaller, manageable parts.

## Objectives
Learn to define and use functions in C++.
Understand the concept of returning values from functions.
Practice obtaining user input and performing basic calculations.
## Requirements
Implement a function named getAnIntFromTheUser that prompts the user to enter an integer and then returns this integer.
Create a function named compareTwoInts that takes two integers as parameters and returns the larger of the two.
Develop a function named sumTwoInts that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.
Your main function should use these three functions to demonstrate their functionality.
## Suggested Implementation Steps
Define the getAnIntFromTheUser function to ask for an integer and return it.
Define the compareTwoInts function to compare two integers and return the larger one.
Define the sumTwoInts function to calculate and return the sum of two integers.
In your main function, use getAnIntFromTheUser to obtain two integers from the user.
Display the result of compareTwoInts and sumTwoInts using the integers obtained.
## Tips
Remember to include comments explaining what each part of your code does.
Test your functions with different inputs to ensure they work correctly.
Pay attention to the return types of your functions.
## Extension Ideas
Add more functions to perform different calculations, like subtracting or multiplying two integers.
Enhance getAnIntFromTheUser to check if the input is actually an integer and prompt again if not.
## Submission Guidelines
Submit your source code file with clear and verbose comments explaining your logic.
Ensure your code compiles and runs correctly without errors.
Include at least one example of each function being used in your main function.

# 3) largestOfThree.cpp
## Overview
This project, titled "largestOfThree.cpp," is designed to help you understand conditional statements in C++. Your task is to write a program that asks the user for three integers, determines the largest among them using nested if statements, and outputs the largest integer.
## Objectives
Practice using if and else statements in C++.
Understand the concept of nested conditional statements.
Develop skills in logical reasoning and problem-solving.
## Requirements
Your program should prompt the user to enter three integers.
Use nested if statements to determine the largest of the three integers.
Output the largest integer to the user.
## Suggested Implementation Steps
Write code to get three integers from the user.
Implement nested if statements to find the largest integer.
Display the largest integer with a message.
Test your program with various sets of numbers to ensure it works correctly.
## Tips
Make sure to handle cases where two or all three numbers are equal.
Pay attention to your program's readability and use clear variable names.
## Extension Ideas
Modify the program to determine the largest integer using compound test statements (using logical operators like && and ||) instead of nested if statements.
Compare the two methods (nested if vs. compound decision statements) and determine which one is easier to understand and why.
## Extra Credit Assignment
Create a flowchart representing the algorithm of your program. This will help you visualize the decision-making process in your code.
## Submission Guidelines
Submit your source code file with comments explaining each part of your code.
Ensure your program accurately identifies the largest integer in all test cases.
Include your thoughts on which method (nested if or compound decision statements) you found more understandable, and why.
For extra credit, submit a flowchart of your program's logic.
